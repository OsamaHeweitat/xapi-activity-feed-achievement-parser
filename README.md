# X API Activity Feed Achievement Parser
Parses the activity feed data generated by X API for achievements.

I initally made this in order to be able to grab the earn date for achievements earned offline, as it doesn't show up on the XBOX website or tracking websites.

Use [X API](https://xapi.us/) to get an auth token and simply enter it when prompted.
